# Arduino : Industrial Data Logger Designing and Programing

I have designed the course for the following mentioned datalogger, that teaches you how to design hardware and do programing for it.

This repository includes following things.

* Images of Datalogger
* Hardware design files and firmware files for Industrial DataLogger.
* Examples codes used in demos of all the sections of datalogger.
* hardware descreption section includes descreptions for all the hardware blocks of datalogger. 
* Libraries used in demo code
