# Industrial-Datalogger-Project
This repository includes following things.

* Images of Datalogger
* Hardware design files and firmware files for Industrial DataLogger.
* Examples codes used in demos of all the sections of datalogger.
* hardware descreption section includes descreptions for all the hardware blocks of datalogger. 
* Libraries used in demo code

I have designed a cource for this data logger that will help you to learn hardware designing and programing, you can check the following link (Following link includes coupen code)
